## Data and control

_"When your business is defined by knowledge, who owns the knowledge controls your company"_


Modern cloud computing promises to companies the freedom from IT headaches.
Like in a hallucinogens trip it can be a bad trip.

And even in a good trip, you __lose control__ on data.

## Storage is all you need
![bg right:33%](storage.jpg)

-Modern personal devices are powerful enough to process data locally but they are not always online and easily accessible

Servers on the cloud offer high availability, including back-up, maintainance and firewalls

Storage can be end-to-end encrypted, reducing the exposure to the cloud ops.

## Woland principles

1. Data on the Cloud is always encrypted and the cloud ops do not own the keys
2. Data can be replicated on different platforms, including local storage and low availability storage
3. Decryption keys are only on end devices
4. Local caching is nice to have
5. Old data may expire, or not
