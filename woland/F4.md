## Abstract
This document defines the 

## Framework
The framework is based on two acts:
- facts: statements about the system. For each statement specify the defining 
properties, the identifying properties (key) and the lifetime
- actions: operations that 

Each act is played multiple times as follows:
1. Define: 
2. Describe
3. Simplify
