# Woland Design
## Storage is all you need

---
![bg right:33%](elevator.jpg)
## Elevator Pitch

Woland stores data on the cloud without losing control of it. 
Data is E2E encrypted and easy to move. 
Access is granted only to owners.

---

## Identity
An identity uniquely identifies a user

An identity is made of:
- a private key, accessible only to the identity owner
- a public key, shared with other peer
- human friendly 

The key support EC asymmetric encryption and digital signature.

## ID
An id is a 64 bits identifier made

|Reserved|Timestamp|Hash|Seq|
|-|-|-|-|
|1 bit|41 bits|16 bits|6 bits|

Timestamp in ms since the Epoch, and hash is sha1 of another 64 bit identifier

## Store

A store is an abstraction of storage services, such as S3 or SFTP. It provides functions to list the content, read and write it.
```
ReadDir(store, name, filter)
Read(store, name, range, dest, progress) 
Write(store, name, source, progress)
Stat(store, name)
Delete(store, name) error
```

## Portal
A portal is a remote location where data is securily stored. 

A portal is accessible via an access token, defined by a name, an AES encryption key and one or more URLs, each pointing to a store. The information is encoded with the private key of an identity

## Zone
A zone is part of a portal that is accessible to a list of users. 
Each zone has one or more encryption key.
Each zone has at least one admin (usually the creator).

Only admins can add ore remove users from a zone; the authority is based on trust, meaning that a change is accepted only when signed by an admin.

Only admins can create an access token.

---
## API

```
Open(token, options)
Close(portal)
Share(token, from, to)

ListZones(portal, mine)
AddUsers(portal, zone, users)
RemoveUser(portal, zone, time, users)
ListUsers(portal, zone)

List(portal, zone, filter)
Put(portal, zone, name, source, options) 
Get(portal, zone, name, dest, options)
Delete(portal, zone, name) error

```

```

## Layout elemens
 
- .touch files are modified every time 
- .user contains user information
- msg files are user specific messages
- users folder contain a subfolder for each usr
- zones folder contain a subfolder for each zone
- head files contain the header of a file
- body files contain the body of a file

---
## Keys

Three different encryption keys:
1. optionally each portal has a AES key (part of access token) to encrypt names on the store
2. each zone has a AES key to encrypt headers
3. each header has a AES key to encrypt the body

The second key is encrypted with the private key of each user and kept in the group information

---

## Zone file

A zone file contains update about users belonging to the zone and key information

```yaml
